				<h3>Predicting toxicity through machine learning</h3>

					We use machine learning methods to predict the effects of chemicals on aquatic species. Our main goal is to use a combination of data from in-vivo (whole organisms) and in-vitro (cell culture) experiments to infer the effects of chemicals on organisms for which no testing data is available (both for the chemical and for the organism). In the literature, this kind of problem is also known as across-chemical (and across-species) extrapolation. Usually, extrapolation across chemicals is performed using measures of chemical similarity under the assumption that similar chemicals will be similarly toxic to the same species. Extrapolation across species can be performed based on measured chemical effects on some species and the similarity between species, either by phylogenetic distance or sequence/structure similarity of known molecular targets of the chemicals, if at all available, or as well through similarity in physiological traits. Given the enormous number of chemicals and of potentially affected species, extrapolation chemical by chemical or species by species is a daunting task.
					Our approach is different. In an interdisciplinary effort by ecotoxicologists and ML experts, we will combine thus far unconnected data to obtain predictions of toxicity across chemicals and species. ML allows the process to be agnostic to previously-determined notions of similarity between species or chemicals. We will use a variety of data sources and types, all available in different publicly available tools and databases, combining chemical structure, data on chemical testing on different organisms, and chemical testing in in-vitro assays.

				<h3>High-dimensional activated dynamics</h3>

					Activated dynamics is a very slow process that takes place on exponentially large time scales. Usually it is associated to barrier hopping. However, activation can also be driven by entropy, which completely changes the way we should think of relaxation in complex systems. We study the emergence of entropically activated dynamics in several systems, from toy to machine learning models.

					This project contributes to the Blue Green Biodiversity Research Initiative â€“ an Eawag-WSL collaboration focusing on Biodiversity at the interface of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.

					We compare invasions in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems primarily at large (national) spatial scales and among several higher-level taxa (insects, molluscs, crustaceans, all major vertebrate classes, and plants). We calculate native-exotic richness ratios and test the biotic resistance hypothesis while simultaneously accounting for other potential factors that could influence invasiveness and invasibility (i.e., species traits, propagule pressure, and the size of species pools).

				<h3>Community Detection</h3>
					<div style="width: 100%; height: 150px; overflow: hidden">
						<img src="https://www.eawag.ch/fileadmin/Domain1/Abteilungen/siam/schwerpunkte/data_science/exposure.jpg" width="100%" alt="A collage of plankton images from our underwater camera"> 
					</div>
					</br>
					Community detection consists of extracting the affinity between agents of a system, which
					is extracted from quantities such as the frequency of interactions. When analyzing datasets,
					however, the absence of a connection between agents might not be due to a lack of affinity,
					but rather to the fact that these agents never met. For example, Sandra and Paul would like
					each other a lot, if they only met.

					We introduce exposure into community detection, as an additional mechanism to explain the
					lack of links among agents. For problems in which being exposed to other agents is crucial
					towards the development of an affinity, this leads to enhanced community detection. In our
					example, our community detection scheme is aware that if Sandra and Paul never met, it
					might be either because they are incompatible, or just because they have not met yet.
