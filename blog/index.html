		<h4>Gender identity</h4>
		We tend to think that, if we are different from what the dominant social norm proposes, we are wrong. We question ourselves (instead of maybe questioning society) and try to fix ourselves.</br>
		If I do not have a social attraction towards anyone, I will interrogate myself what is wrong with me. My friends will ask what is wrong with me. My (heteronormative) therapist will too. But maybe it's also fine not to be attracted to anyone, that's who I am, it doesn't harm anyone, and I can be happy with who I am. Maybe this will change, and if it will change I will be able to embrace my new state.</br>
		I am not saying that we should not be introspective and we should only blame society. This is however not my experience. My experience is that people that do not ascribe to dominant roles are in a continuous struggle trying to fit and solve their demerit.</br>
		Realizing that there is nothing wrong with who we are, that's the catharsis. All of a sudden you're ilight, you're happy.</br></br>

		Labels are usually not a good idea, since they are a very coarse approximation of the universe. However, more labels are a better approximation than few labels, and having new ones helps us understand that perhaps we do not need to subscribe to the ones that already exist.
