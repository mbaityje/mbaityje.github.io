		<h4>Elevator pitch</h4>
		I am a Group Leader at Eawag (Switzerland). With my group, I use methods from machine learning and statistical physics to approach problems mainly related to water systems. In addition, I am interested in understanding the dynamics of high-dimensional systems (such as deep neural networks or glasses) in the presence of a large number of constraints.
		In addition to my research topics, I have a personal concern about how science, as an instrument of power and knowledge, can be used both to improve our lives and to perpetrate injustice.

	<h4>Career path</h4>
	<p>
		Currently, I am a research scientist at <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University in the City of New York</a>, USA. Before this, I was at <a href="www-centre-saclay.cea.fr/en">CEA Saclay</a> in France, at the 
		<a href="http://www.ucm.es">Universidad Complutense de Madrid</a> in Spain, and at <a href="http://www.uniroma1.it">Sapienza, University of Rome</a> in Italy.
