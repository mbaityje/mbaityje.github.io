		I am a Group Leader at Eawag. With my group, I use methods from machine learning and statistical physics to approach problems mainly related to water systems. In addition, I am interested in understanding the dynamics of high-dimensional systems (such as deep neural networks or glasses) in the presence of a large number of constraints.

		/*
		Throughout my carrier, I <a href="/research"> focused on</a>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Learning dynamics of Deep Neural Networks</p></li>
			<li><p>Activated dynamics in high-dimensional toy models</p></li>
			<li><p>Applying methods from machine learning and statistical physics to ecology</p></li>
			<li><p>Dynamics of supercooled liquids</p></li>
			<li><p>Energy landscape, phase transitions and dynamics in spin glasses</p></li>
			<li><p>Jamming of sphere packings</p></li>
		</ul>

		Currently, I am a research scientist at <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University in the City of New York</a>, USA. Before this, I was at <a href="www-centre-saclay.cea.fr/en">CEA Saclay</a> in France, at the 
		<a href="http://www.ucm.es">Universidad Complutense de Madrid</a> in Spain, and at <a href="http://www.uniroma1.it">Sapienza, University of Rome</a> in Italy.
