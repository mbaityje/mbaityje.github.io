	<h1>Marco BAITY JESI (site under construction)</h1>
	<p>
		I am a computational physicist, interested in statistical physics and hard optimization problems.
		My broad research topic is rugged landscapes, intended as high-dimensional systems that often have
		a large number of solutions separated by barriers. 
		I investigate the statistical properties of such systems, and how the dynamics takes place.

		Throughout my carrier, I have been <a href="/research"> focused on</a>
		<ul>
			<li>Learning dynamics of Deep Neural Networks</li>
			<li>Activated dynamics in high-dimensional toy models</li>
			<li>Applying method from machine learning and statistical physics to ecology</li>
			<li>Dynamics of supercooled liquids</li>
			<li>Energy landscape, phase transitions and dynamics in spin glasses</li>
			<li>Jamming of sphere packings</li>
		</ul>

		Currently, I am a research associate at <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University in the City of New York</a>, USA. Before this, I was at <a href="www-centre-saclay.cea.fr/en">CEA Saclay</a> in France, at the 
		<a href="http://www.ucm.es">Universidad Complutense de Madrid</a> in Spain, and at <a href="http://www.uniroma1.it">Sapienza, University of Rome</a> in Italy.
