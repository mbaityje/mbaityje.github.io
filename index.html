		Update pitchh! // I am a computational physicist, interested in statistical physics and hard optimization problems.
		My broad research topic is <em>rugged landscapes</em>, intended as <em>high-dimensional</em> 
		systems that often have a large number of solutions separated by barriers. 
		I investigate the statistical properties of such systems, and how the dynamics takes place.</br>

		Throughout my carrier, I have been <a href="/research"> focused on</a>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Learning dynamics of Deep Neural Networks</p></li>
			<li><p>Activated dynamics in high-dimensional toy models</p></li>
			<li><p>Applying methods from machine learning and statistical physics to ecology</p></li>
			<li><p>Dynamics of supercooled liquids</p></li>
			<li><p>Energy landscape, phase transitions and dynamics in spin glasses</p></li>
			<li><p>Jamming of sphere packings</p></li>
		</ul>

		Currently, I am a research associate at <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University in the City of New York</a>, USA. Before this, I was at <a href="www-centre-saclay.cea.fr/en">CEA Saclay</a> in France, at the 
		<a href="http://www.ucm.es">Universidad Complutense de Madrid</a> in Spain, and at <a href="http://www.uniroma1.it">Sapienza, University of Rome</a> in Italy.
