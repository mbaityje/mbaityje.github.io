	<h1> Un-Frequently Asked Questions </h1>
	<h3> Questions I cannot answer</h3>
	<p class="content">
	  Some questions I've been turning my head around, without finding an appropriate answer.
	  At some point I will try to get a better understanding on these concepts. For the moment it's just a sketch of things I appreciate input on.

		<h4>Is society a marginal system?</h4>
		I have the sensation that society keeps itsself at the edge of stability. Probably somebody already showed this and I would love to be pointed to the reference.

		<h4>Does power corrupt?</h4>
		My sensation is that, at least to a degree, it does. This would imply that people with greater power should be particularly careful of not abusing it (which is not the same a the 2000-year old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_great_power_comes_great_responsibility"> quote</a> from Spiderman). A corollary, would be that powerful people are more likely to have a corrupt soul (though they might as well not). A solution would be avoiding power imbalance at all. This wouldn't mean that positions of great responsibility wouldn't exist, because great responsibility can come without great power.

		<h4>Does private property make sense in the digital world?</h4>
		Our society is built upon a concept of private property. Leaving aside the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon">observations</a> on its ill-definedness, I observed during my youth how with the advent of digitilization this concept fell apart, and we struggled to keep it alive with a lot <em>ad hoc</em> regulations. Was this the only way to deal with digital private property? Am I the only one that thinks that some kind of sharing that seemed admirable in the 80s now is now borderline illegal?
		I really do not have a clear idea around this, but in some part of my mind I feel that we did not openly and transparently lay all the options on the table.

	<h3> Questions I can more or less answer </h3>
		<h4>Should knowledge be freely accessible to everyone?</h4>
		Yes, and this makes me doubt on the legitimacy of private intellectual property. This does not mean that I am advocating to get rid of it, since this would require a complete restructuring of society, which is beyond the scope of what I feel comfortable advocating for here.

		<h4>Does society need to be restructured?</h4>
		Global inequality and environmental change are two major reasons that demonstrate that we obviously should change, the sooner the better.

		<h4>Are rich people smarter?</h4>
		They are not. Even though this should be self-evident (except for those whose agenda is helped by this kind of retorics), let me point to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022053103000243?casa_token=SCPi63BgIyYAAAAA:h8FRSsHISgIV0pQqWh0BCRKtUVrfHGC43d0NhbB2mjlxT_jgsMkI_Ww_5X9sbfFj2Bc0DYRHXA"> nice paper </a> by Levy (sadly it is published for profit, but at least it's not behind a paywall) showing that the ability of the richest can be upper-bounded by a low value.
		Randomness and privilege play a major role.

		<h4>Should being smarter justify privilege?</h4>
		Set aside the fact that the concept of <em>being smart</em> is subjective, the answer to this kind of question depends is subjective as well, since it depends on our personal moral and ethics. According to my personal moral and ethics my answer is <em>no</em>.

		<h4>Are some genders/collectives smarter than others?</h4>
		This kind of question is often used to justify discriminative attidudes.
		There is no reasonable evidence in favor of this kind of statement, though there is a ton of material showing how discriminated collectives such as women or African Americans (just to name two out of a plethora) suffer from systematic biases that make their lives much harder. If any such kind of statement needs to be done, it is that northwestern white cis males should by now all be semi-gods given the amount of privilege they enjoyed, and since they are not, perhaps we should start doubting about their talent.
		Of course, the real answer is that our world is complex and cannot be trivialized by any kind of such statements.</br>

		But the real point here is well-depicted by a <a href="https://magazine.scienceforthepeople.org/vol22-1/science-wars-the-next-generation/">statement</a> by Michael Harris:
		<p style="font-style: italic;" class="content">
		[...] given how little we know about the relation between mathematics and the brain, why is it urgent to establish differences between the mathematical behavior of male and female brains? The gap is so vast between whatever such studies measure and anything resembling an appreciation of the difficulties of coming to grips with the conceptual content of mathematics that what really needs to be explained is why any attention, whatsoever, is paid to these studies. Ingrained prejudice is the explanation that Occam’s razor would select.

		However, even though these questions are malevolent, I cannot exclude that in a far future it will be clear that different collectives have different kinds of abilities (as it happens in Orwell's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm"> Animal Farm</a>). The question could be then: <em>Would these differences justify any kind of power imbalance or even oppression?</em> I tend pretty much towards the opinion that even if some kind of superiority of a collective was demonstratable, this would not be a sufficient reason to grant it a higher degree of power.
		
		<h4>Is a totally free market desirable?</h4>
		There is a huge load of literature in economy showing that it is of course not, unless you're at the tip of the pyramid. But be ware, you need to be at the very tip. In fact, under <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.05789.pdf">mild assumptions</a> it can be shown that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05118"> in an unregulated market the inequality increases </a> all the way to a Gini index of 1, which indicates a single person having all the wealth. So, in a free market, even if you're rich, it is just a matter of time before you become incredibly poor too. In other words, for long enough times, an unregulated market is undesirable for all humans except one (and probably that single human wouldn't be a happy folk either).

		<h4>Did you copy the idea of UFAQs from D.Knuth's webpage?</h4>
		Yes. I lack imagination but stand on the shoulders of giants.
