	<h1> Un-Frequently Asked Questions </h1>
	<p>
	  Some questions I've been turning my head around, without finding an appropriate answer.
	  At some point I will try to phrase some proper answers. For the moment it's just a sketch of things I appreciate input on.
		<h4>Does power corrupt?</h4>
		My sensation is that yes, it does. This would imply that people with greater power should be particularly careful of not abusing it (which is not the same a the 2000-year old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_great_power_comes_great_responsibility"> quote</a> from Spiderman). A corollary, would be that powerful people are more likely to have a corrupt soul (though they might as well not). A solution would be avoiding power imbalance at all. This wouldn't mean that positions of great responsibility wouldn't exist, because great responsibility can come without great power (and this would in my view be a trait of a healthy utopian society).

		<h4>Is society a marginal system?</h4>
		I have this sensation, but am currently not able to show it. Probably somebody already showed this and I would love to be pointed to the reference.

	  Questions I'm able to answer
		<h4>Are rich people smarter?</h4>
		No, for god's sake. Even though this should be self-evident (except, apparently, those whose agenda is helped by this kind of retorics), there is a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022053103000243?casa_token=SCPi63BgIyYAAAAA:h8FRSsHISgIV0pQqWh0BCRKtUVrfHGC43d0NhbB2mjlxT_jgsMkI_Ww_5X9sbfFj2Bc0DYRHXA"> nice paper </a> by Levy (sadly it is published for profit, but at least it's not behind a paywall) showing that the ability of the richest can be upper-bounded by a low number.

		<h4>Are some genders/collectives smarter than others?</h4>
		This kind of question begs for a "yes", so that people can incorporate their concept of superiority into societal oppression.
		There is no reasonable evidence in favor of this kind of statement, though there is a ton of material showing how discriminated collectives such as women or African Americans suffer from systematic biases that make their lives much harder. If any such kind of statement needs to be done, it is that northwestern white cis males should by now all be semi-gods given the amount of privilege they enjoyed, and given they are not, perhaps we should start doubting about their skills.
		Of course, the real answer is that our world is complex and cannot be trivialized by any kind of such statements.

		But the real point here is well-depicted by a <a href="https://magazine.scienceforthepeople.org/vol22-1/science-wars-the-next-generation/">sentence</a> by Michael Harris:
		<it>
		[...] given how little we know about the relation between mathematics and the brain, why is it urgent to establish differences between the mathematical behavior of male and female brains? The gap is so vast between whatever such studies measure and anything resembling an appreciation of the difficulties of coming to grips with the conceptual content of mathematics that what really needs to be explained is why any attention, whatsoever, is paid to these studies. Ingrained prejudice is the explanation that Occam’s razor would select. [Humanizing Mathematics and its Philosophy: Essays Celebrating the 90th Birthday of Reuben Hersh, ed.  B. Sriraman (Cham, Switzerland: Birkhäuser, 2017), 117.]
		</it>

		However, even though these questions are malevolent. I cannot exclude that in a far future it will be clear that different collectives have different kinds of skills (as it happens in Orwell's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm"> Animal Farm</a>). The question qould be then: "Would these differences justify any kind of power imbalance or even oppression"? I tend pretty much towards the opinion that even if some kind of superiority of a collective was demonstratable, this would not be a sufficient reason to grant it a higher degree of power.
		
		<h4>Did you copy the concept of UFAQs from D.Knuth's webpage?</h4>
		Yes. I lack imagination but stand on the shoulders of giants.
