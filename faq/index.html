		<h4>Can I join your group for an internship?</h4>
		If after surfing my whole website you are still motivated in doing your project in my group, then you are likely welcome to join.
		However, this changes along the year, because I do not always have enough time to supervise students, and because some projects might not be available anymore.
		Also, although I often have projects that are suitable for a bachelor or masters thesis, the subjects vary and some may not suit your background.


		<h4>Which kind of background should I have to join your group?</h4>
		This depends a lot on the project and should be taken with a grain of salt. For the more theoretical projects, mathematics, theoretical physics or computer science. For the applied ones, data science, statistics and environmental engineering.

		<h4>What kind of project could I do in your group?</h4>
		This highly depends on when you apply. At the moment I have open problems in statistical physics (dynamics of REM and p-spin model), machine learning (testing a method we developed for data imbalance), and toxicity prediction (applying methods to predict the LC50 of chemicals on species).

<!-- 		<h4>How is your last name pronounced?</h4>
		Say it as you prefer, I don't really mind.
